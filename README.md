# BanWindows11
Tool to disable Windows 11 Update for Windows 10.
## Note

**I no longer maintain this project.** This was a project I created in the past to automate the process of disabling Windows 11 updates. Although I no longer actively develop or support it, you are welcome to use this tool if you find it useful. It may still be functional for its intended purpose.

If I decide to recreate something similar in the future, I will provide a reference to it here.

## Details

**Story of me creating this tool:** I had Windows 11 installed of my main PC and it has a lot of bugs and like 5 months of using it, my PC got destroyed by Windows 11. Every program encounters an error also it got Visual Studio corrupted, I got mad at it and installed Windows 10 back again. It started pop-ups to ooh I see you run Windows 10 but Windows 11 is better it destroys your PC want to upgrade? After that, I even bought Windows 10 Pro license to disable it easily.

This tool disables it through the registry. Group Policy support coming soon.

- .NET Framework 4.8.1
